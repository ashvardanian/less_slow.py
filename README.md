# _Less Slow_ Python

> The spiritual little brother of [`less_slow.cpp`](https://github.com/ashvardanian/less_slow.cpp).

Much of modern code suffers from common pitfalls: bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. University curricula often teach outdated concepts, while bootcamps oversimplify crucial software development principles.

![Less Slow Python](https://github.com/ashvardanian/ashvardanian/blob/master/repositories/less_slow.py.jpg?raw=true)

This repository offers practical examples of writing efficient Python code.
The topics range from basic micro-kernels executing in a few nanoseconds to more complex constructs involving parallel algorithms, coroutines, and polymorphism. Some of the highlights include:

- 

To read, jump to the `less_slow.py` source file and read the code snippets and comments.

## Reproducing the Benchmarks

If you are familiar with Python and want to review code and measurements as you read, you can clone the repository and execute the following commands.

```sh
pytest less_slow.py
```
